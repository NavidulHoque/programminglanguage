            <p class="card-text">Computer programming is the process of writing code that contains instructions that computers can understand and follow. These instructions are called computer programs, and every function a computer performs is a result of accurately written code. Computer programmers write in unique languages that can only be read and understood if you have studied computer coding.
              The field is constantly evolving as technology advances, so a career in computer programming is an exciting opportunity for anyone interested in coding and using computer languages.</p>
