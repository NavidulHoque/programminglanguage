    <h2>C++ Programming Language</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Last Updated : 04 Sep, 2021</p>
    <p><span class="text-danger fw-bold">C++</span>is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same.  </p>
    <h4 class="fw-bold">Applications of C++: </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Operating Systems & Systems Programming. e.g. Linux-based OS (Ubuntu etc.)</li>
      <li>Browsers (Chrome & Firefox)</li>
      <li>Graphics & Game engines (Photoshop, Blender, Unreal-Engine)</li>
      <li>Database Engines (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis etc.)</li>
      <li>Cloud/Distributed Systems</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="fw-bold">
      Some interesting facts about C++: 
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of C++ signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C. “++” is the C increment operator.</li>
      <li>C++ is one of the predominant languages for the development of all kind of technical and commercial software.</li>
      <li>C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance.</li>
      <li>C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language.</li>
      <li>A function is a minimum requirement for a C++ program to run.(at least main() function)</li>
    </ul>
