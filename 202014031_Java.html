    <h2>Java Programming Language</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Last Updated : 04 Sep, 2021</p>
    <p><span class="text-danger text-uppercase fw-bold">Java</span> is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.</li>
      <li>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
      <li>Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.</li>
      <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.</li>
      <li>Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications, enterprise applications, and many more.</li>
      <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.</li>
      <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="text-danger text-uppercase fw-bold">It</span> is used for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
      <li>Desktop applications</li>
      <li>Web applications</li>
      <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
      <li>Games</li>
      <li>Database connection</li>
      <li>And much, much more!</li>
    </ul>

           <h2 class="text-primary">1. Junior Developer</h2>
           <p>A junior developer position is where everyone will start. This is the lowest position for a software engineer. A person in this position will be responsible to write, analyze, test, and debug code. Generally, they are part of teams that have mentors and leaders whom they have to report to.

            At this stage, the developer must focus on getting familiar with the industry practices as generally, it is their first job. One must also focus on developing new skills to get better at their craft and thus either switch to a better company or have a better position in the same company. This is one of the good Java career opportunities.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">2. Senior Developer</h2>
            <p>A senior developer is a person generally responsible for taking charge of a complete project. They are also responsible for writing some code and having to report to the executive officers and managers of the company. Along with all this, they are also responsible for mentoring the developers that are new to the company or the project they are working on. It is seen as the standard job position for a developer.</p>

      <div class="row mt-3">
        <div class="col-12">
           <h2 class="text-primary">3. Architect</h2>
           <p>A java architect is responsible for designing and developing the layout of the application. They categorize the different logic layers that further helps in the separation of concerns among the team members working on the project as you have seen in the image above.

            The architect is expected to come up with the best technologies that are well-suited for the software to be built and ensure that they are all compatible with each other.
            
            Other than these, you will also find field-specific job postings that require the programmer to be efficient in a particular set of things. These are generally posted by large companies who don’t need a Java programmer who can do a number of things but a programmer skilled in a particular area, generally for optimization or enhancement of an existing product.</p>

            4. Java Web Developer
           </h2>
           <p>This is usually a backend position, and the person is responsible for deploying and maintaining server-side code. With the growing culture of cloud-based systems, it is helpful if you know the basics of cloud computing and has experience in using code to the cloud.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">5. Java Android Developer</h2>
          <p>The developer is responsible for building or adding features to android applications. This is the most common job posting that you will see out there and is also a wanted position in several startups.

            Since every company and service now has a mobile app, the market for these jobs will not dry up anytime soon.</p>

          <h2 class="text-primary">6. Java EE developer</h2>
          <p>These developers are given the job of building and maintaining enterprise software. They are generally posted by big companies and look for a developer with some industry experience.</p>
