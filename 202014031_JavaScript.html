    <h2>Java Script Programming Language</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Last Updated : 04 Sep, 2021</p>
    <p class="mt-4"><span class="fw-bold text-uppercase text-danger">JavaScript</span> is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for <span class="text-success fw-bold">Client-side</span> developments as well as <span class="text-success fw-bold">Server-side</span> developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like <span class="text-success fw-bold">Array</span>, <span class="text-success fw-bold">Date</span>, and <span class="text-success fw-bold">Math</span>, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. </p>
    <ul class="ps-3">
      <li><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Client-side:</span> It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are <span class="fw-bold text-success">AngularJS</span>,<span class="fw-bold text-success">ReactJS</span>, VueJS and so many others.</li>
      <li class="mt-3"><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Server-side:</span> It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is <span class="fw-bold text-success">node.js</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Features of JavaScript:</span> According to a recent survey conducted by <span class="fw-bold text-success">Stack Overflow</span>, JavaScript is the most popular language on earth. 
      With advances in browser technology and JavaScript having moved into the server with Node.js and other frameworks, JavaScript is capable of so much more. Here are a few things that we can do with JavaScript: 
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
        <li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object. They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
        <li>Can handle date and time.</li>
        <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
        <li>No compiler is needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <div>
      <p class="fw-bold text-primary">Applications of JavaScript: </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Web Development:</span> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Web Applications:</span> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Server Applications:</span> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Games:</span> Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Smartwatches:</span> JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the internet for its functioning.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Art:</span> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.</li>
        <li class="mb-4"><span class="fw-bold">Machine Learning:</span> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.</li>
