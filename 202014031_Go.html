    <h2>Go Programming Language </h2>
    <p>Last Updated : 05 Mar, 2021</p>
    <p><span class="text-danger text-uppercase fw-bold">Go</span> is a procedural programming language. It was developed in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google but launched in 2009 as an open-source programming language. Programs are assembled by using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. This language also supports environment adopting patterns alike to dynamic languages. For eg., type inference (y := 0 is a valid declaration of a variable y of type float).</p>
    <h5 class="fw-bold text-danger">Why Golang? </h5>
    <p>The main purpose of designing Golang was to eliminate the problems of existing languages. So we started with the problems that we are facing with Python, Java, C/C++ languages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Python – “Easy to use, but slow” :</span> Python is easy but slow as it is an interpreted language that makes the code slow.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Java – “Complex type system” :</span> Java has a complex type system due to it additional features which makes it more complex and slow.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">C/C++ –</span> “Complex type system as well as slow compilation time” : C/C++ was designed when the computer does not have that much space so the developer decided to optimize the compiler by using the minimal amount of space which results in sluggish compiler time.</li>
      <li class="mb-3">Also, all these languages were designed when multi-threading applications were rare, so not much effective to highly scalable, concurrent and parallel applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold">Features of Golang:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Strong and Statically Type language:</span> Go is Strong as well as Statically type language. Strong means once you created some variable using some data type then for the whole application it will remain type. Statically means all the variables have to define at compile time.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Excellent Community:</span> Golang have an excellent community for issue tracking and solution.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Fast Compilations:</span> Golang will includes only that packages which will import directly in the code.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Garbage collections:</span> Automatic garbage collection of Go is very fast.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Built-in Concurrency:</span> Go has the built-in feature of concurrency. Using Go Routines and channels you can handle the concurrency very easily and effectively.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold">What is a Golang developer?</h5>
    <p>Golang (also called Go) is a statically typed, compiled programming language that was developed by Google in 2009. The language combines the efficiency of C++ efficiency and the readability of Python.

      Golang developers use the Go language to build webpage and software products. A Go developer’s general duties include working with Go and using its full suite of tools and frameworks. Most Go developers also do testing and debugging.
      
      Most job postings for Golang developers require a wide variety of other skills as well, the most common being:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experience with scripting (Shell/PERL)</li>
      <li>Experience in application design using design patterns</li>
      <li>Javascript, SOAP, REST Webservices, or Microservices</li>
      <li>Experience using Git</li>
      <li>Knowledge of DevOps practices</li>
    </ul>
