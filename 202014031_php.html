    <h2>PHP | Introduction</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">Last Updated : 21 March, 2021</p>
    <p>The term <span class="text-danger fw-bold">PHP</span> is an acronym for PHP: <span class="text-success">Hypertext Preprocessor</span>. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”. Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participating in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>PHP code is executed in the server.</li>
      <li>It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Informix.</li>
      <li>It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.</li>
      <li>It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.</li>
      <li>Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.</li>
      <li>One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.</li>
      <li>The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.</li>
      <li>The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Other characteristics of PHP are as follows.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple and fast</li>
      <li>Efficient</li>
      <li>Secured</li>
      <li>Flexible</li>
      <li>Cross-platform, it works with major operating systems like Windows, Linux, MacOS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-primary fw-bold mt-4">Why should we use PHP?</h5>
    <p>PHP can actually do anything related to server-side scripting or more popularly known as the backend of a website. For example, PHP can receive data from forms, generate dynamic page content, can work with databases, create sessions, send and receive cookies, send emails etc. There are also many hash functions available in PHP to encrypt user’s data that makes PHP secure and reliable to be used as a server-side scripting language. So these are some of the abilities of PHP that makes it suitable to be used as server-side scripting language. You will get to know more of these abilities in further tutorials. 

      Even if you are not convinced by the above abilities of PHP, there are some more features of PHP. PHP can run on all major operating systems like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X etc. Almost all of the major servers available today like Apache supports PHP. PHP allows using wide range of databases. And the most important factor is that it is free to use and download and anyone can download PHP from its official source : <a href="https://www.php.net/" class="text-success">www.php.net</a>. </p>
    
    <h3 class="text-danger mt-5">Career Opportunities in PHP</h3>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h4 class="text-primary">1. Command-line Scripting</h4>
          <p>This function is primarily concerned with parsing on web servers so that the user browser gets the correct HTML. PHP parsers can run the script without a server program or browsers. PHP scripting allows developers to pass the files as a command-line argument to WinSQL, which then runs the functions sequentially. Therefore, it is a practical approach that is also easy to use and effective. </p>

      <div class="row mb-3">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h4 class="text-primary">2. Server-side Scripting</h4>
          <p>In this technique, scripts are employed on a web to produce a customized response for client requests posed to a website. So, it is the central area of operation where PHP developers can showcase their expertise. 

            Server-side scripting includes programs and applications like web browsers, web servers, and also PHP parsers.</p>

          <h4 class="text-primary">3. Database Concepts</h4>
          <p>User interaction entails the processing of data stored in files and databases. So, database concepts are integral to the job of PHP developers. A database can be described as a collection of data resources or information. 

            As a PHP developer, you should be able to integrate the PHP language with database management tools, such as MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql, Oracle, among others. </p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h4 class="text-primary">4. Desktop Application Development</h4>
          <p>PHP’s capabilities as a language also extend to developing client-side applications that can be installed and run locally on users’ computers. In a desktop application, the graphical user interface or GUI holds prominence in ensuring that the human-computer interaction is efficient and comfortable. 

            Since the underlying logical design plays a vital role, successful PHP developers have a thorough understanding of client-side scripting languages, including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>

          <h4 class="text-primary">5. Web Development Careers</h4>
          <p>Several web development jobs like web designers, web architects, and webmasters are open to PHP proficient candidates. The primary duties of these posts could consist of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Building the foundation of websites</li>
            <li>Selecting color and text style</li>
            <li>Monitoring site performance</li>
            <li>Keeping a tab on web traffic</li>
            <li>Applying HTML coding skills to add new features </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="text-primary">6. Compiler Based Applications</h4>
          <p>If you are well-versed in a particular language other than PHP, you can build an application in that language and later align it with the PHP ecosystem. For instance, you can create extensions with PHP using the C language. The same concept is used by the Magento platform, an e-commerce solution. This feature of PHP brings flexibility to the work of developers, and thus enables innovative applications. </p>
