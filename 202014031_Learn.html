        <h1 class="text-danger mb-3">7 Other Programming Languages to Consider</h1>
        <p>The following programming languages aren’t quite as popular as the 10 listed , but they are also worth considering if you’re looking to expand your programming options.</p>
        <ul class="ps-3">
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Dart</span> is optimal for programming applications that need to run on multiple platforms, such as Windows and iOS. </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Kotlin</span> is used to develop applications for the Android OS. </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">MATLAB</span> is a proprietary language developed by MathWorks and used for scientific research and numerical computing. </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Perl</span> got its start for programming text, which makes it easy to learn and popular for developing a proof of concept. </li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Ruby</span> is losing traction as compared to other languages, but the Ruby on Rails framework was influential to other, later Web application frameworks for Python, PHP, and JavaScript.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Rust</span> emphasizes high performance and security and is useful for applications where many things are happening concurrently.</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="fw-bold text-success">Scala</span>, named as a play on scalable language, is compatible with Java and is useful for cloud-based applications. </li>

          <h2 class="text-primary">1. Dart</h2>
          <p>Dart is a programming language designed for client development, such as for the web and mobile apps. It is developed by Google and can also be used to build server and desktop applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">2. Kotlin</h2>
          <p>Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.</p>

          <h2 class="text-primary">3. Matlab</h2>
          <p>MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">4. Perl</h2>
          <p>Perl is a general-purpose programming language originally developed for text manipulation and now used for a wide range of tasks including system administration, web development, network programming, GUI development, and more.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">5. Ruby</h2>
          <p>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">6. Rust</h2>
          <p>Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. ... Rust has been called a systems programming language and in addition to high-level features such as functional programming it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.</p>

        <div class="col-12">
          <h2 class="text-primary">6. Scala</h2>
          <p>Scala is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming language which supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming. ... Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a syntax termed curly-brace which is similar to the language C.</p>
