    <h2>R Programming Language </h2>
    <p>Last Updated : 05 Mar, 2021</p>
    <p><span class="text-danger text-uppercase fw-bold">R</span> is an open-source programming language that is widely used as a statistical software and data analysis tool. R generally comes with the Command-line interface. R is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Also, the R programming language is the latest cutting-edge tool.

      It was designed by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by the R Development Core Team. R programming language is an implementation of the S programming language. It also combines with lexical scoping semantics inspired by Scheme. Moreover, the project conceives in 1992, with an initial version released in 1995 and a stable beta version in 2000.</p>
    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold">Why R Programming Language?</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>R programming is used as a leading tool for machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. Objects, functions, and packages can easily be created by R.</li>
      <li>It’s a platform-independent language. This means it can be applied to all operating system.</li>
      <li>It’s an open-source free language. That means anyone can install it in any organization without purchasing a license.</li>
      <li>R programming language is not only a statistic package but also allows us to integrate with other languages (C, C++). Thus, you can easily interact with many data sources and statistical packages.</li>
      <li>The R programming language has a vast community of users and it’s growing day by day.</li>
      <li>R is currently one of the most requested programming languages in the Data Science job market that makes it the hottest trend nowadays.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold">Features of R Programming Language</h5>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Basic Statistics:</span> The most common basic statistics terms are the mean, mode, and median. These are all known as “Measures of Central Tendency.” So using the R language we can measure central tendency very easily.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Static graphics:</span> R is rich with facilities for creating and developing interesting static graphics. R contains functionality for many plot types including graphic maps, mosaic plots, biplots, and the list goes on.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Probability distributions:</span> Probability distributions play a vital role in statistics and by using R we can easily handle various types of probability distribution such as Binomial Distribution, Normal Distribution, Chi-squared Distribution and many more.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Data analysis:</span> It provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="text-danger fw-bold">R Programming Language Job Positions</h5>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">R Programmer–</span> The job of R programmers is to use their programming skills and knock down the data and create tools that can ease the process of data analysis. They use data structures such as vectors, matrices, and data frames which help in quick and efficient development. Average salary of an R programming job is $77,722 per year.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Data Scientist–</span> This is one of the paths which is in demand for R programmers. A data scientist has the responsibility for designing and implementing layouts for large data sets, data modeling, data mining, research purposes, and prediction. Data is money these days. A person analyzing this data is sure to be awarded with a whopping amount of $123,000 a year on an average.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Data Analyst–</span> A data analyst should be a mixture of technical and analytical knowledge. A data analyst should be the one who is well-versed in finding, retrieving, wrangling, and delivering insights from data. In addition to this, a DA should have in-depth information regarding a database system and machine learning. A data analyst can get up to an average of $69,979 per year.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Data Architect–</span> Many domains these days are in need of data architects. Data architects integrate and maintain their data sources. They must be in line with the latest technologies like Spark to stay relevant. Also, a data architect must be aware of data warehousing solutions, database architecture, ETL and BI tools, data modeling, and system development. Data architect gets paid up to $112,764.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Data Visualization Analyst–</span> A data visualization analyst should be able to create and distribute interactive dashboards that will give all information to make major business decisions. They provide an extensive graphical report that helps the business in predictions and making decisions that will help the business grow. The salary for this profession is $84,809.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Geo Statisticians–</span> These professionals are taking the responsibility for examining spatial and spatiotemporal datasets. Roughly, this subset of R professionals get about $71,000 per year.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Database Administrator–</span> A database administrator ensures that a database is available to all users that require a particular set of data. They ensure that all data has a backup and recovery mechanism. They also need to take care of data modeling, design, data security and should be well versed with the business they are involved in.</li>
      <li class="mb-3"><span class="fw-bold">Quantitative Analysis with R–</span> In all different domains like finance, telecom, hospitality, etc. quantitative analysis ensures that all portfolios are risk-balanced and help us in finding new opportunities and evaluate all assets prices using mathematical models.</li>
    </ul>
